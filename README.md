# SongPredictionViz

This app (available on https://elastic-curran-c983f0.netlify.com/) shows several graphs that allow us to interpret the initial song prediction dataset and the model output.

Description
The scatterplots give the user an overview of the song dataset.
For the first one, the blue dots represent a song that is not a hit, while the red ones represent a hit song. For the second scatterplot, the red dots represent the songs that the model had succesfully predicted if the song would be a hit.
The plotted properties can be dynamically changed by updating the two axis dropdowns.
